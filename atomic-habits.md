# Summary

## Cheat-sheet

Cheat-sheet is available, in nicer format, [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/Atomic+Habits/Habits+Cheat+Sheet.pdf).

Both the creation of a good habit and the destruction of a bad habit follow the same format of:

1. Make it obvious
2. Make it attractive
3. Make it easy
4. Make it satisfying

In the case of bad habits, however, these rules are inversed.

### To create a good habit

#### Make it Obvious

1.1 - Fill out the Habits Scorecard. Write down your current habits to become aware of them.
1.2 Use implementation intentions: "I will [BEHAVIOUR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]."
1.3 Use habit stacking: "After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]."
1.4 Design your enironment. Make the cues of good habits obvious and visible.

#### Make it Attractive

2.1 Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.
2.2 Join a culture where your desired behaviour is the normal behaviour.
2.3 Create a motivation ritual. Do something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit. 

#### Make it Easy

3.1 Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits.
3.2 Prime the environment. Prepare your environment to make future actions easier.
3.3 Master the decisive moment. Optimise the small choices that deliver outsized impact.
3.4 Use the Two-Minute Rule. Downscale your habits until they can be done in two minutes or less.
3.5 Automate your habits. Invest in technology and onetime purchase that lock in future behaviour.

#### Make it Satisfying

4.1 Use reinforcement. Give yourself an immediate reward when you complete your habit.
4.2 Make "doing nothing" enjoyable. When avoiding a bad habit, design a way to see benefits.
4.3 Use a habit tracker. Keep track of your habit streak and "don't break the chain".
4.4 Never miss twice. When you forget to do a habit, make sure you get back on track immediately.

### To break a bad habit

#### Make it Invisible

1.1 Reduce exposure. Remove the cues of your bad habits from your environment.

#### Make it Unattractive

2.1 Reframe your mindset. Highlight the benefits of avoiding your bad habits.

3.2 Use a commitment device. Restrict your future choices to the ones that beenfit you.

#### Make it Unsatisfying

4.1 Get an accountability partner. Ask someone to watch your behaviour.
4.2 Create a habit contract. Make the costs of your bad habits public and painful.

# Activities

## Habits scorecard

To directly quote James Clear's [website](https://jamesclear.com/habits-scorecard):

> To create your own Habits Scorecard, start by making a list of your daily habits.
> 
> Here’s a sample of where your list might start:
> 
> * Wake up
> * Turn off alarm
> * Check my phone
> * Go to the bathroom
> * Weigh myself
> * Take a shower
> * Brush my teeth
> * Floss my teeth
> * Put on deodorant
> * Hang up towel to dry
> * Get dressed
> * Make a cup of tea
>
>  … and so on.
> 
> Once you have a full list, look at each behavior, and ask yourself, “Is this a good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral habit?” If it is a good habit, write “+” next to it. If it is a bad habit, write “–”. If it is a neutral habit, write “=”.
