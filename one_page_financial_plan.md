# The One Page Financial Plan

[The one Page Financial Plan](https://www.amazon.com.au/One-Page-Financial-Plan-Simple-Smart/dp/1591847559) is a book by Carl Richards. 

It is a gentle introduction to financial planning, with an emphasis on understanding and setting reasonable goals.

## What should be on the one page?

The following are extremely high level components of what should be on the page. The book is primarily composed prompts and methods for fleshing out these ideas.

1. Why is money important to you?
    * And dig further into this - why, why, why. Work into what your priorities are.
2. What are your financial goals?
    * These should be relatively SMART, or at least concrete. Consider the prompt: "What is the goal? When do you want to do it? How much will it cost?"
3. Where are you now?
    * Create a list of your assets and liabilities - like a "positives and negative" comparison.
    * In particular, are there any debts you'll need to pay down?

To be honest, that's about it. The rest of the book is focused on budgeting, investing, spending, and saving, and all of that important good stuff.
