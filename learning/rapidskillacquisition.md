# Rapid Skill Acquisition

Drawn from [The First 20 Hours](https://first20hours.com). These checklists are designed to assist in the acquisition of new skills.

Importantly, this is not a recipe for expertise building. This is for progressing from "no skill" to "I can do it passably". 

## Ten major principles of rapid skill acquisition

1. Choose a lovable project.
2. Focus your energy on one skill at a time.
3. Define your target performance level.
4. Deconstruct the skill into subskills.
5. Obtain critical tools.
6. Eliminate barriers to practice.
7. Make dedicated time for practice.
8. Create fast feedback loops.
9. Practice by the clock in short bursts.
10. Emphasise quantity and speed.

Most of that is pretty clear, but some important items to clarify:

* *Focus your energy on one skill at a time* - if you're learning-interested, it's tempting to keep picking up many new skills at a time. In practice, you really need to pick one and one only. 
  (The caveat is that "RSA" is focused on the first 20 hours: therefore new skills will be deferred up to 20 hours at most, in theory.)
* *Define your target performance level* - create a simple sentence (or a few, maybe) that define what "good enough" looks like. This is similar to setting a SMART goal. "A problem well stated is a problem half solved."
* *Deconstruct the skill into subskills* - consider that a skill being approached is actually more likely a bundle of smaller subskills. You can then define which subskills are the most important and focus energies there.
* *Create fast feedback loops* - coaches and mentors are great sources of eedback. Capture devices or specific training tools can be of use.
* *Emphasise quantity and speed* - like the parable of the ceramics teacher, "in early-stage practice, quantity and speed trump absolute quality."

## Ten principles of effective learning

With the major principles well defined, we explore how to improve our *learning*:

1. Research the skill and related topics.
2. Jump in over your head.
3. Identify mental models and mental hooks.
4. Imagine the opposite of what you want.
5. Talk to practictioners to set expectations.
6. Eliminate distractions in your environment.
7. Use spaced repetition and reinforcement for memorisation.
8. Create scaffolds and checklists.
9. Make and test predictions.
10. Honor your biology. 

Again, clarifiying some points:

* *Research the skill and related topics* - do your background reading. Look for common themes. What are useful, common techniques? Build a bit of a background, but be wary of analysis paralysis.
* *Imagine the opposite of what you want* - utilise *inversion*. Consider the opposite of what you would want to happen - what's the worst-case? Now, imagine the opposite of that, and aim for it. Dumb, but effective.
* *Create scaffolds and checklists* - some definitions:
  * '*Checklists* are handy for remembering things that must be done every time you practice. They're a way to systematise the process, which frees your attention to focus on more important matters.'
  * '*Scaffolds* are structures that ensure you approach the skill the same way every time. Think of the basketball player who establishes a pre-free-throw routine.'
