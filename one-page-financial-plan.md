It is a gentle introduction to financial planning, with an emphasis on understanding and setting reasonable goals.

## What should be on the one page?

The following are extremely high level components of what should be on the page. The book is primarily composed prompts and methods for fleshing out these ideas.

1. Why is money important to you?
    * And dig further into this - why, why, why. Work into what your priorities are.
2. What are your financial goals?
    * These should be relatively SMART, or at least concrete. Consider the prompt: "What is the goal? When do you want to do it? How much will it cost?"
3. Where are you now?
    * Create a list of your assets and liabilities - like a "positives and negative" comparison.
    * In particular, are there any debts you'll need to pay down?
4. Understand your cash flow.
   * Where does it come from? Where does it go? Create a budget.
5. Protect yourself.
   * Understand what insurance you have and how much you need.
6. Understand debt.
   * Do you have debt? Are you managing it effectively?
7. Invest intelligently.
   * Broadly speaking - invest, do not trade. These are not the same things.
8. Get help.
   * Find an accountability partner - whether it be a financial advisor or coach.
9. Do it.
   * Make Palpatine proud.
